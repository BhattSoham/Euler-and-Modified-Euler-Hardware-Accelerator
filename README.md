# Hardware Accelerator Design for ODE Solvers #

In this new era of high-performance computing, hardware accelerators play a pivotal role in handling a specific task or closely related set of tasks, offering
significant performance improvements for those specific functions or operations. Some of these hardware accelerators are integrated into the central processing unit (CPU) itself. Hardware accelerators are meticulously crafted to deliver superior performance, and they often outperform general-purpose CPUs in their designated tasks. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) play a fundamental role in modeling and simulating various dynamical systems. They provide an exact and
analytical way to find exact solutions, but sometimes, it may be hard to obtain an accurate solution due to the complexity of the system. Here, numerical
method analysis comes into play. These analyses help us in approximating the solutions to the differential equations, which makes it possible to study the
behavior of the system effectively. The goal of this repository is to implement various methods of numerical analysis in solving ordinary differential equations. The work has been specifically done using Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Descriptive Language (VHDL) in Xilinx Vivado Software. The accelerator is typically deployed on the Zynq ZC702 FPGA Evaluation Kit.
