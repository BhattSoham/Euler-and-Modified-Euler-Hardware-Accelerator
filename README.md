# Hardware Accelerator Design for ODE Solvers #

The goal of this repository is to implement various methods of numerical analysis in solving ordinary differential equations. The work has been specifically done using Very High-Speed integrated circuit Hardware Descriptive Language
(VHDL) in Xilinx Vivado Software. The accelerator is typically deployed on the Zynq ZC702 FPGA Evaluation Kit.

The documentation for downloading Xilinx Vivado and the basic tutorial for learning VHDL has been given below:
